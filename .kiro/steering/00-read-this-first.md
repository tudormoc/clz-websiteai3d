# Project Rules

1. **DRY** - No duplicate code/styles. Reuse components and utilities.
2. **Single Source of Truth** - Constants in `config/`, translations in `locales/`.
3. **No Hardcoding** - Use translation keys, config constants, Tailwind classes only.
4. **Clean Code** - Remove unused files, imports, dead code immediately.
5. **Comments** - Brief notes explaining what code references and its purpose.
6. **Small Components** - One responsibility each. Extract when logic repeats.
7. **Type Safety** - Use TypeScript types. Define shared types in `types.ts`.
8. **Follow Patterns** - Match existing codebase conventions.
9. **File Structure** - One component per file. Group related components in folders.
